                    A gymnasium, also known as a gym, is an indoor location for athletics. 
                    The word is derived from the ancient Greek term "gymnasium".
                    They are commonly found in athletic and fitness centers, and as activity and learning spaces in educational institutions.
                    "Gym" is also slang for "fitness centre", which is often an area for indoor recreation.
                    A "gym" may include or describe adjacent open air areas as well.
                    In Western countries, "gyms" (or pl: gymnasia") often describe places with indoor or outdoor courts
                    for basketball, hockey, tennis, boxing or wrestling, and with equipment and machines used for
                    physical development training, or to do exercises. In many European countries,
                    Gymnasium (and variations of the word) also can describe a secondary school that prepares
                    students for higher education at a university, with or without the presence of athletic courts, fields, or equipment.

                   The Church of Our Lord Jesus Christ was the name of the church I attended during the last couple of weeks.
                   It was my friendsâ€™ church that was located in Brazil, Indiana.
                   It was a fairly small church compared to other churches I have been to.
                   It was a primarily black church with a few other races that attended also.
                   This church had a guy drumming during every song that was song.
                   I found this church to be very different from the ones we discussed in class.
                   This church service was interesting to me because the worship service was charismatic
                   and it inspired many that were in the church at the time.
                   During the time we spent in class talking about the culture of churches,
                   one thing that stood out to me was that no one caught the Holy Ghost like we watched in the video in class.

                    A theatre company is an organisation that produces theatrical performances,
                    as distinct from a theatre troupe (or acting company), which is a
                    group of theatrical performers working together.
                    Modern theatre includes performances of plays and musical theatre.
                    The art forms of ballet and opera are also theatre and use many conventions
                    such as acting, costumes and staging. They were influential to the development
                    of musical theatre.

                    Typically, a courier provides their courier service on a commercial
