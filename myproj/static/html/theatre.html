                    A theatre company is an organisation that produces theatrical performances,
                    as distinct from a theatre troupe (or acting company), which is a
                    group of theatrical performers working together.
                    Modern theatre includes performances of plays and musical theatre.
                    The art forms of ballet and opera are also theatre and use many conventions
                    such as acting, costumes and staging. They were influential to the development
                    of musical theatre.
