                    A gymnasium, also known as a gym, is an indoor location for athletics. 
                    The word is derived from the ancient Greek term "gymnasium".
                    They are commonly found in athletic and fitness centers, and as activity and learning spaces in educational institutions.
                    "Gym" is also slang for "fitness centre", which is often an area for indoor recreation.
                    A "gym" may include or describe adjacent open air areas as well.
                    In Western countries, "gyms" (or pl: gymnasia") often describe places with indoor or outdoor courts
                    for basketball, hockey, tennis, boxing or wrestling, and with equipment and machines used for
                    physical development training, or to do exercises. In many European countries,
                    Gymnasium (and variations of the word) also can describe a secondary school that prepares
                    students for higher education at a university, with or without the presence of athletic courts, fields, or equipment.
