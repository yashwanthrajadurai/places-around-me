                   The Church of Our Lord Jesus Christ was the name of the church I attended during the last couple of weeks.
                   It was my friendsâ€™ church that was located in Brazil, Indiana.
                   It was a fairly small church compared to other churches I have been to.
                   It was a primarily black church with a few other races that attended also.
                   This church had a guy drumming during every song that was song.
                   I found this church to be very different from the ones we discussed in class.
                   This church service was interesting to me because the worship service was charismatic
                   and it inspired many that were in the church at the time.
                   During the time we spent in class talking about the culture of churches,
                   one thing that stood out to me was that no one caught the Holy Ghost like we watched in the video in class.
